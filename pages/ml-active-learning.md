# Active Learning Strategies

- Bias towards uncertainty
- Bias towards ensemble disagreement
- Bias towards labels most likely to influence classifier
- Bias towards denser regions of training data

Look at your training data with the largest error! They are likely human error and you can take them out. The ones aren't is really important to leave in because those are the onces that are really influence your model.

Look for edge cases

# Semi-Supervised Learning

Transductive Support Vector Machine

# Multitask Learning

Multiple language

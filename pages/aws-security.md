# Identity And Access Management (IAM)

IAM is to manage, control and govern authentication, authorization and access control mechanisms of 
identities of your resources within your AWS Account. Identities are required to authenticate AWS accounts.
Access Management relates to authorization and access control. IAM is a global service.

Access control:
- username and password 
- [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](#multi-factor-authentication-mfa) 
- [federated access](#identity-federation)

IAM components:
- [Users](#users)
- [Groups](#groups)
- [Roles](#roles)
- [Policy Permissions](#policies)
- Access Control Mechanisms

### Users

A user can represent a real person who requires access to operate and maintain your AWS environment or
it can be an account used by an application that requires permissions to access your AWS resources
programmatically.

Access keys are required for programmatic access for authentication. These keys must be applied and
associated with your application. If you're using the AWS CLI to access a resource, you first have 
to instruct the AWS CLI to use these Access Keys. this association ensures that all API request
are signed with this digital signature.
- Access Key ID - Made up of 20 random uppercase alphanumeric characters.
- Secret Access Key ID - Made up of 40 random upper and lowercase characters. 
It's notpossible to retrieve lost Secret Access Key IDs!

**AWS CodeCommit** is a managed source control service. It allows you to host secure and scalable 
private Git repositories.

### Groups

IAM Groups are not used in authentication process. They are used to authorize access through AWS Policies.
IAM Groups contain IAM Users and have IAM policies associated. (AWS managed policies and/or Customer managed
policies)

### Roles

For example, you have an EC2 instance running an application that requires access to Amazon S3 to Put
and Get objects using the relevant API calls. You can assign an IAM Role to the EC2 instance. You should
always associate a role to an EC2 instance for accessing AWS resources over storing local credentials
on the instance itself.

Roles don't have any access keys or credentials associated with them. The credentials are dynamically 
assigned by AWS. You can alter the permissions assigned to the Role and all the EC2 instance associated 
will have the correct access.

There are currently 4 different types of Roles:
- AWS Service Role
- AWS Service-Linked Role - These roles do not allow you to modify permissions assigned.
- Role for Cross-Account Access. This role type offer two options:
  - Option 1: provide access between AWS accounts that you own.
  - Option 2: provide access between an account that you own and a third party AWS account.
  - The **trusting** account has the resources that need to be accessed. The **trusted** account contains 
  users that need to access the resources in the trusting account.
    1) A role is created in the trusting account.
    2) A trust is established with teh role by the AWS account number of the trusted account.
    3) Permissions are applied to the Role via **policies**.
    4) The users in the trusted account have a **policy** attached.
- Role for Identity Provider Access
  - Grant access to web identity providers - creates a trust for users using Amazon Cognito, amazon, Facebook,
  Google or other provider.
  - Grant Web Single Sign On to SAML Providers - allows access for users coming from a Security Assertion
  Markup Language (SAML) provider.
  - Grant API access to SAML Providers - Allows access from SAML provider via the AWS CLI, SDKs or API calls. 

### Policies

IAM Policies are used to assign permissions. They are formatted as a JSON document and have at least one 
statement with this structure:

~~~json
{
    "Version": "2020-12-25",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "Stmt123456789012",
        "Action": "cloudtrail:*",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
          "IpAddress": {
            "aws:SourceIp": "10.10.0.0/16"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
}
~~~

There are two types of IAM Policies: 
- Managed Policies
  - AWS Managed Policies
  - Customer Managed Policies
- In-line Policies
  - They are directly embedded into a specific user, group or role.
  - If there are conflicting permissions assigned to the same user, follow:
    - By default, all access is denied.
    - Access will only be allowed if an explicit "Allow" has been specified.
    - A single "Deny" will overrule any "Allow".
  

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA utilizes a random 6 digit number generated by an MFA device. There is no additional charge for this. You need 
to own a MFA device which can be a physical token or a virtual device. The MFA device must be configured and 
associated to the user. This configuration can be done from within IAM.

## Identity Federation

Identity federation allows you to access and manage AWS resources even if you don't have a user account
within IAM. Identity providers (IdP) allow users to access AWS resources securely. There must be a trust 
relationship between the IdP and your AWS account. AWS supports two types of IdP:
- OpenID such as Facebook, Google, Amazon. Amazon Cognito
- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): allows your existing MS-AD users to authenticate to your AWS
resources on a SSO approach.

**Security Token Service (STS)** allows you to gain temporary security credentials for federated users via IAM.

An example:

1. The user initiates a request to authenticate against the **ADFS server** via a web browser using a **SSO URL**.
2. If the authentication is successful by the AD credentials, SAML will then issues a **successful authentication
assertion** back to the users' client requesting federated access.
3. The SAML assertion is sent to the AWS STS to assume a role within IAM using the **AssumeRoleWithSAML API**.
4. STS responds to the user requesting federated access with temporary security credentials with an assumed
role and associated permissions.
5. The user then has federated access to the necessary AWS services as per the role permissions.

## Features of IAM

- Account settings - password policy and security token service regions.
- Credential Report - a list of all your IAM users and credentials. The report will only be generated once in 4 hours.
- Key Management Service (KMS)

# AWS Organization

AWS Organizations uses the following components to help you manage your accounts.
- Organizations
- Root
- Organizational Units
- Accounts
- Service Control Policies (SCPs)

**Master account** is a standard AWS account that you have chosen to create the AWS organization. The best 
practice to use this account solely as a master account and not to use it to provision any other resources.
This allows you to restrict to the master account at a greater level. The fewer users who need access to it,
the better. The master account carries certain administrative level capabilities, such as being able to
create additional AWS accounts within your organization, invite other accounts to join your organization,
remove AWS accounts from your organization and apply security features via policies to different levels within 
your organization.

## Security Control Policies (SCP)

An SCP does NOT grant access, they add a guardrail to define what is allowed. You will still need to configure
your identity-based or resource-based policies to identities granting permission to carry out actions
within your accounts.

# AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

AWS WAF helps to prevent web sites and web applications from being maliciously attacked by common web
attack patterns. It is used to identify how Amazon CloudFront distributions and application load
balancers respond to web requests. It filters both HTTP and HTTPS request distinguishing between
legitimate and harmful inbound requests.

AWS WAF Componnets:
- **Conditions** - conditions allow you to specify what elements of the incoming HTTP or HTTPS request you want WAF to be 
  monitoring for.
  - Cross-site scripting
  - Geo match
  - IP addresses
  - Size constraints
  - SQL injection attacks
  - String and regex matching
- **Rules** - a WAF rule allows you to compile one or more of these conditions into a list which acts as a rule
where each condition is ANDed to form the complete rule.
- **Web ACLs** - rules can be added to Web ACLs. Within the web ACL, an action is applied for each rule. These
actions can either be Allow, Block or Count. **Rules are executed in the order** that they are listed within a 
Web ACL. As soon as the request matches all the conditions within a rule it will be associated with that rule
regardless of if there is another rule further down that would also be a match.

AWS WAF integrated with CloudWatch allowing you to monitor set metrics for the service. WAF CloudWatch metrics are 
reported in one minute intervals by default and are kept for a 2 week period. The metrics monitored are:
- AllowedRequests
- BlockedRequests
- CountedRequests
- PassedRequests

AWS WAF limitations
- 100 conditions of each type except Regex which allows only 10 conditions
- 100 rules and 50 Web ACLs per account
- 5 rate-based-rules per account
- 10,000 requests per second for WAF with your ALB 

AWS WAF relies heavily on AWS CloudFront distributions. It also supports custom origins allowing you to 
apply the same level of security to web infrastructure managed outside of AWS. The association between 
the Web ACL and a CloudFront distribution can take approximately 15 minutes for the Web ACL and associated
rules to be propagated. When a request is blocked by WAF, CloudFront is notified that the request was 
forbidden and returns a 403 error to their browser. You can create your own custom 403 error to guide 
the user to other useful links and provide a polite reason as to why they may have experienced the error. 

AWS WAF Pricing: there are three chargeable elements of AWS WAF. You will not be charged extra for assigning
the same Web ACL to multiple distributions.
- the number of incoming requests
- the number of web ACLs that you have
- the number of Rules within each of the Web ACL

<br />

# AWS Firewall Manager

AWS Firewall Manager has been designed to help you manage WAF in a multi-account environment with simplicity
and control. It allows you to protect your vulnerable resources across all of your AWS accounts within your 
AWS Organization. It can group and protect specific resources together, e.g. all resources with a particular
tag or all of your CloudFront distributions. It automatically protects certain resources that are
added to your account as they become active. 

Before using the Firewall Manager, there are some prerequisites:
- ensure your AWS account is a part of an AWS Organization which much have been configured with all features.
- define which AWS account will act as the **Firewall Manager Admin**.
- ensure you have **AWS Config** enabled.

Components of AWS Firewall Manager:
- **WAF Rules** - contain conditions.
- Rule Groups **- allow you to group together one or more WAF rules that will have the same action applied. You 
ca**n create your own rule group and add your own WAF rules, or purchase existing rule groups via the AWS
Marketplace. Rule Groups can only contain 1 of 2 actions, these being either Block or Count. You can only have 
10 rules per group which can not be increased.
- **Firewall Manager Policies** - contain the rule groups that you want to assign to your AWS resources. You can
only have 2 rule groups per policy: one customer created rule group, one AWS Marketplace rule group.

<br />

# AWS Shield

**AWS Shield** has been designed to protect your infrastructure against DDoS attacks. AWS Shield itself is 
available at two different levels of features: 
- **AWS Shield Standard** (free) for network and transport layers.
- **AWS Shield Advanced** (additional cost) for network, transport and application layers.

> **DDoS attack** target a web host and it receives a huge number of requests simultaneously from multiple
> distributed sources. It prevent legitmate requests getting through whilst at the same time severely
> hindering the performance of the application or website.
> Types of DDoS attacks:
> - SYN flood
> - DNS query flood
> - HTTP flood/Cache-busting

<br />

When activating AWS Shield Advanced, 
- you need to manually select the resources needing protection. You can select the resources using 
ARNs. You must associate an EIP address to your EC2 instance for it to be protected.
- you must add rate-based rules. These rate-based rules are only associated with CloudFront distribution
and application load balancers. For each supported resource in the list, it is recommended you associate 
a Web ACL with a rate-based rule.
- you may or may not authorize the AWS DRT (the AWS DDoS Response Team) to review, update and modify your Web
ACLs and Shield configurations during an attack. If you want the assistance of the DRT team, you must be 
subscribed to either the business or enterprise support plans.

# Supervised Learning

## Classification Problem

### Logistic Regression

#### One-vs-All (One-vs-Rest)

multi-class

### SVM: Support Vector Machine Hypothesis

### Neural Network

- activation units
- bias nodes x_{0}

## Regression Problem

### Linear Regression

### Polynomial Regression

# Unsupervised Learning

## Clustering

### K-Means

# PCA: Principal Component Analysis

Reduce data from n-dimensions to k-dimensions

## Application: Dimensionality Reduction

- Data Compression
- Data Visualization

## [u, s, v] = svd(sigma)

U_{reduce} = u(:, 1:k)
Z = U_{reduce}' * x; (~~x_{0}=1~~)
